# React Module Federation Application

React platform implementing micro-frontend architecture version 1.0 through [https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).

This project aims to keep a reference for the old / previous v1.0 implementation through Webpack 5 since the information and examples across the web are getting scarcer.
